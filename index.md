# So You Want to Play Dungeons and Dragons

**Otherwise known as: you're not afraid of being called a *nerd* (because you are one)**

*How long does a typical D&D campaign run, and are there specific tools or items I need to start one? I've always wanted to play D&D, but I know it's a bit of a time commitment and can be difficult to get people on board if they're less familiar with the game. I guess I just want to know what the proper route to get started would be!*

## Getting Started

I love Dungeons and Dragons (hereafter called D&D). It is by far my favorite tabletop game (sorry [Mille Fiori](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/346501/mille-fiori)) and it has maintained its legacy by staying in my life almost weekly ever since I started playing it around four(?) years ago. It's an incredible experience, rooted in collaborative storytelling, roleplaying, and a combat system that feels pretty good--at least when you don't have to deal with the [CR system](https://www.modularrealms.com/en-us/blogs/news/how-does-the-challenge-rating-cr-system-work-in-dungeons-and-dragons?srsltid=AfmBOooiCoKLCGDH3VIkYpHvpmUzaBcJWjrZmo4n0q0Pf1Vb9G_LS0dX). I highly recommend *not* going down that rabbit hole unless you have a masochistic urge to crunch numbers and balance encounters. If that sounds appealing, you do you.

All of this to say: D&D is great, and I recommend that you play it, or one of the other popular TTRPG (Table-Top Role-Playing Game) systems out there like [Pathfinder](https://paizo.com/pathfinder), [Warhammer 40K](https://cubicle7games.com/en_US/our-games/warhammer-40k-roleplay-imperium-maledictum?srsltid=AfmBOorBIFRhXw_Y06qFDfk9VMmmr4tP2-SCc2ujekaxURKxjQ_mv2ez), [Vampire: The Masquerade](https://renegadegamestudios.com/game-worlds/vampire-the-masquerade/vampire-the-masquerade-roleplaying-game/?srsltid=AfmBOopJ2G4-oOLkWRBaRh14_uw_c52v48Qwdr9CwCZta7aBi-mKy589), [Daggerheart](https://www.daggerheart.com), or [The Cosmere RPG](https://www.brotherwisegames.com/cosmere-rpg) to name a few. You can have fun with pretty much any system, though they all have their own rules and nuances to understand.

But this is about D&D. How do you get started? There are a lot of ways to do so, but I've found that the easiest way to get started is to start as a player, with a group of friends or [friendly strangers who are willing to help you learn](https://startplaying.games). Any tabletop game is made better when someone can explain it to you.

Not everyone has the privilege to find a group immediately, though, especially if you don't know any or if you want to found one. If that's the case, there are many alternative resources you can look at.

## Learning Resources

The most obvious resource for learning D&D is Wizards of Coast's official documentation--namely the Player's Handbook ([2024 edition](https://online.anyflip.com/mldog/ynbn/mobile/) or [5e](https://archive.org/details/players-handbook_202308/page/145/mode/2up)), [Dungeon Master's Guide](archive.org/details/dungeon-masters-guide), and [Monster Manual](https://online.anyflip.com/ivdl/igol/mobile/index.html#p=1). These are essential books that contain the rules for playing D&D, and while they're good resources, most people use them as a reference guide rather than a place to actually learn the rules.

If you can't learn by playing, it helps to learn by watching. One of the best ways to be a better DM (Dungeon Master) especially is to watch other people DM. There are hundreds of live-play campaigns online like [Critical Role](https://www.youtube.com/@criticalrole/playlists), [Legends of Avantris](https://www.youtube.com/@LegendsofAvantris), and [Dimension 20](https://watch.dropout.tv/dimension-20). Many of these shows are famous for having skillful DMs and often have their own unique style. Observing how these games run, their rhythms, and their DM's actions can make a home game much more fun and professional.

## Playing the Game

I wanted to conclude this newsletter with a few starting resources that might be of use to you. After you've learned *how* to play D&D, you'll need to set up a campaign.

Campaigns can be of any length. They range from a one-shot, which lasts two to six hours, to an 100+ session campaign, which can last multiple years. Be wary of long campaigns, though, as the biggest enemy of any D&D campaign is scheduling issues.

Regardless, everyone in the campaign (except the DM) will need to make a character with a certain [race](https://www.dndbeyond.com/species?srsltid=AfmBOoryTjIkLMMchkmGtFhcXeMpNbGDI4uxQG-tM0zExMMHTEFN_V0k) and [class](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes?srsltid=AfmBOoqszYpoWLz-HXOn8Zlv0eQCaMj91wn_N9MHo-sET9WH-5S-UrLm). Spellcasters will need [spells](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells). If you don't have a physical [character sheet](https://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/5E_CharacterSheet_Fillable.pdf), you can  use [D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/en?srsltid=AfmBOopcBdu3Dcf7Pl9K8JIojZpEX1d0MwJFt22nPFCG8z7l887q2wmL) to track characters digitally.

Once character creation is finished, you can start playing the game. The DM will prepare for the session, either through a homebrew campaign or  a [campaign book](https://www.hipstersanddragons.com/adventures/) depending on your preferences.

Either way, the objective is to have fun. I encourage you to explore the many, many resources about D&D that exist online. You don't need much of anything to play it, so long as you have the friends, patience, and links to do so.
